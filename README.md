# centenis
Centenis is an application used to detect and diagnose early stage Alzheimer's disease and dementia, and in addition to being able to be used as a tool to treat victims of brain injury. It utilizes IBM Watson's Visual Recognition API and BigHugeLab's Thesaurus API to classify a standard set of images. The app presents the user with a series of image which they try to identify, and their answer is checked with the classifications generated by Watson's computer vision algorithms.

To run the app:

1. Run `git clone https://github.com/calufornia/centenis.git` in an appropriate directory.

2. Set up a Python virtual environment in the same directory as step 1 by first running `pip install virtualenv`, and then `virtualenv -p /usr/bin/python2.7 venv`

3. Enter the virtual environment by execeuting `source venv/bin/activate`, and run `pip install -r requirements.txt`

4. In settings.cfg, enter the API keys for Watson's Visual Recognition API and BigHugeLab's Thesaurus API in the respective spots (don't include braces).

5. To launch the app, cd into centenis and run `python centenis.py`
